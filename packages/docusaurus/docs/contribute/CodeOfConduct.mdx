Bill S. Preston Esq. and Ted Theodore Logan are the founders of the band Wyld Stallyns, and the most excellent time travelers in the history of the universe.

They are also the [originators of the Bill and Ted Rule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVXGC896Jdw), which states that all members of the Wyld Stallyns community should "be excellent to each other."

We think this is a pretty good rule, and so have adopted it for our community as well.

If you're ever concerned about whether your behavior is in line with the Bill and Ted Rule, ask yourself: "Am I being excellent to others?" If the answer is "no", then you should stop what you're doing and try to be excellent to others instead.

A more detailed summary of exactly what we think "being excellent to others" means is below.

## What does it mean to "Be Excellent" to Others?
Trust, respect, collaboration and transparency are excellent values, and we want them to live and breathe within our team and project.
"Being excellent" means welcoming participants from around the world with different experiences, unique perspectives, and great ideas to share.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making
participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size,
disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education,
socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of "being excellent to others" include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Attempting collaboration before conflict
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Anything that contributes to creating a positive environment

Examples of unacceptable (or "bogus") behavior by participants include:

- Violence, threats of violence, or inciting others to commit self-harm
- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, intentionally spreading misinformation, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Abuse of the reporting process to intentionally harass or exclude others
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take
appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits,
issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any
contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the
project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline
event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting us anonymously
through [this form](#report-a-violation-of-the-code-of-conduct). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will
result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The team is obligated to
maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent
repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

If you are unsure whether an incident is a violation, or whether the space where the incident took place is covered by
our Code of Conduct, **we encourage you to still report it**. We would prefer to have a few extra reports where we
decide to take no action, rather than leave an incident go unnoticed and unresolved that may result in an individual or
group to feel like they can no longer participate in the community.

Reports deemed as not a violation are still valuable as they allow us to improve our Code of Conduct and processes
surrounding it. If you witness a dangerous situation or someone in distress, we encourage you to report even if you are
only an observer.
